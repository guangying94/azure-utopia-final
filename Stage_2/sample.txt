Complicated Scenarios
Ethical Dilemmas
Dilemma One: If a critical system on Erebus One fails mid-flight and fixing it would endanger half the crew, what protocol should be followed? Does the decision prioritize lives or mission success?
Dilemma Two: If unforeseen alien microorganisms on Utopia exhibit properties harmful to human health, should colonization continue or be paused indefinitely?
